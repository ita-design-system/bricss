## General principles

* **Simple responsive naming convention**: BRiCSS is a simple low-level CSS abstraction and a naming convention based on abbreviations of CSS class names and attributes.
* **CSS you really use**: Just set CSS properties you really use into your designs and code.
* **Responsive on-demand**: Optimized CSS output file size thanks to selective responsive CSS properties you really use.
* **Automatic documentation**: An interactive documentation of CSS output is automatically generated. [Example](https://ita-design-system.github.io/bricss-website-ui/).
* **Low-engineered**: Only a browser is required.
* **JSON based**: BRiCSS is a JSON file base solution to generate a tailored CSS file library.
* **Offline**: Works even with no Internet connection.
* **Design Systems friendly**: Integrates seamlessly into a Design System.
* **Instant file size**: Instantly observe the file size impact of your settings.
* **Copy or download**: Just refresh your browser to get the latest version of your custom CSS library.
* **Machine-readable** optionally download the machine-readable JSON based on your CSS library for any IA agents.

## Requirements

A text editor, a web server and a browser.

## Getting started

1. [Download](https://github.com/ita-design-system/bricss/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) or clone this repository the starter project and unpack to any web server.
2. **Edit** `build.json` file to fit your needs.
3. **Run through your browser!**: Interactive documentation is generated automatically. 
4. **Customize**: Replace all "Project Name" string into the `index.html` file to your own project name. Customize or remove Github link.
5. Optionally download the machine-readable JSON to make it learned by any IA agent. Customize content of the file `AGENTS.md` replacing `PATH_TO_GENERATED_CSS` and `PATH_TO_GENERATED_JSON_REFERENCE` accordingly.

At first start, an onboarding menu with JSON examples is available to help populating your own `build.json`. At least one single CSS property is required to display documentation. When `build.json` is not empty, just click to download or copy your new CSS library.

All JSON examples are placed nto the folder `json_examples` or the repository.
